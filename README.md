# 🔄 Unit Converter

A solo project from the [Scrimba Frontend Developer Career Path](https://scrimba.com/frontend-path-c0j).  
This project is a simple **metric-to-imperial unit converter**. It allows users to quickly convert numbers between metric and imperial units for **length, volume, and mass**.  
Users enter a number, click **Convert**, and the converted values are displayed, rounded to **three decimal places** for readability.
